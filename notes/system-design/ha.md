# High availability

- System continues to operate even if some of its components fail
- System guarantees certain percentage of uptime

## Identifying single points of failure

- Servers running your applications
- Databases
- Load balancers
- Analyse each component and identify single points of failure


## Achieving high availability on AWS

- ELB > EC2 
- Run EC2s in an auto scaling group in multi-AZs
- Achieving HA costs money

- You can use Lambdas to achieve HA
- You can also achieve HA using EKS by using cluster autoscalers which deploy multiple nodes across multiple AZs

## HA vs Fault Tolerance

- In fault tolerant architecture not only is the system HA but performance does not degrade even when a component fails
- Fault tolerance is generally more expensive than HA systems
