# Distributed Systems

## Centralized

- Use client server architecture
- Client sends request to server and server sends response back to client
- Single point of failure
- Scaling is done by adding more CPU and memory
- Examples are apps on local machine, any apps running on single datacenter server, IBM DB2 mainframe, etc


## Distributed aka distributed computing

- System "distributed" across multiple servers
- Scale out by adding more servers aka horizontal scaling
- No single point of failure
- Most modern systems are distributed
